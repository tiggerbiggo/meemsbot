I'm writing some words about something. these words are going to be placed into a blender and blended until nothing makes sense anymore. Bumblebees don't get tired they eat cornflakes. thats a good summary of what you guys were talking about lmao, combine(merge) each subarray back up your nose, down a long winded series of words until we finally arrive at the conclusion. it takes some text in and works out which words come after which words, then it generates random sentences based on the words it was given. I got a warning email about plugging it in too, something about it having two graphics things and how I have to plug it into the right one. The only thing that may be specific to each game is textures. Logic is easy to emulate, graphics are much harder and graphics are generally what takes the resources to work out, beside a select few games. Yeah, it wouldn't benefit them as much to convert every single game, but they could if they put in the resources have a general solution that would automatically be able to play any and all xbox 360 games. The motorway signs said closed, so they took it upon themselves to block 2 lanes even though it's not their job then when the signs change to 40mph they continue to block the road. We have lots of subarray components, the subarray things are all over the place. squirrels hide up trees. Bother, it's sketchy. I've found that it's way more effective if it's all in the same chain, or if you have multiple larger chains. when I did it as every message is on a separate line it was linking them in really short chains then ending them very quickly.
